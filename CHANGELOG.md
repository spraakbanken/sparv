## [5.3.0] - 2025-06-19

### Added

- Added `sparv plugins` command to list and manage Sparv plugins.
- Added `--compact` flag for `sparv schema` command, resulting in compact output.
- Added `--json` flag for `sparv modules` command.
- The command `sparv modules` now also takes annotators in addition to modules as arguments to filter the output.
- The detailed `sparv modules` listings now include info about accepted values for config variables.
- Sparv now respects the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
- Added autocomplete instructions for `zsh`.
- Added 'misc:fake_text_headtail' annotator.
- Added compressed versions of the SBX frequency list exports.
- Added utility functions: `util.install.install_svn` and `util.install.uninstall_svn` for adding files to or removing
  them from an SVN repository (user credentials are retrieved from the environment variables `SVN_USERNAME` and
  `SVN_PASSWORD`).
- Added utility functions: `util.install.install_git` and `util.install.uninstall_git` for adding files to or removing
  them from a local Git repository.
- Added `misc:metadata_from_filename` annotator, to extract metadata from filenames.
- Added support for using `len()` on instances of the `Annotation` class, replacing the `get_size()` method which will
  be removed in a future version of Sparv.
- Sparv can now be used as a library by importing the `sparv` package.

### Changed

- Changed distribution name from `sparv-pipeline` to `sparv`.
- Dropped support for Python 3.8 and 3.9.
- The internal data format (in the `sparv-workdir` directory) has been changed for performance reasons. You will need to
  run `sparv clean` before running Sparv on any existing corpora using the old data format.
- Updated documentation with a fresh new look!
- The parameters `append` and `allow_newline` have been removed from the Sparv class methods to simplify the code.
  The `append` parameter was never used, and newlines are now preserved by default.
- `xml_export:compressed` and `xml_export:compressed_scrambled` no longer need to first create uncompressed combined
  files.
- Removed the `indent_xml` utility function, as ElementTree now supports XML indentation natively since Python 3.9.
- Sparv now prints a warning message if a module, annotator, or output annotation is missing a description.
- Sparv now prints a warning message if an annotator has parameters without type hints.
- Instances of `AnnotationAllSourceFiles`, `AnnotationDataAllSourceFiles`, `OutputAllSourceFiles`, and
  `OutputDataAllSourceFiles` can now be called with a source file name to get the respective non-all-source-files
  instance. This is now the recommended way to use these classes, and the previous methods will be removed in a future
  major release.
- Changed library used for parsing PDF files from `pdfplumber` to `pypdfium2`.
- Plugin module name convention is now enforced.
- The `logs` directory is now always created relative to the corpus directory instead of the directory where `sparv` is
  run.
- Detailed error messages are now always printed to the log file, no matter the log level.
- The `outputs` parameter for importers can now accept a list of multiple `Config` objects, instead of just one.

### Fixed

- Fixed Stanza, which was broken for English.
- SweNER no longer hangs on extremely long tokens.
- Fixed configuration validation for `korp.context` and `korp.within`.
- Fixed a crash when removing namespaces from attributes in `xml_import:parse`.

- Fixed bug in `stats_export` which caused it to crash sometimes.
- Better handling of whitespace in tokens in the `cwb` and `wsd` modules.
- Fixed SSL certificate verification issues when downloading models.
- Fixed problem when entering relative path as Sparv data directory.

  memory that was available when Sparv started.
- Stanza now always selects the GPU with the most free memory.
- The preloader can now be gracefully stopped by sending an interrupt signal to the Sparv process.

  `korp:wordpicture_sql` and `korp:install_wordpicture` respectively.
- Target path is no longer optional for the utility functions `install_path` and `rsync`.
- The classes `SourceAnnotations` and `SourceAnnotationsAllSourceFiles` are now pre-parsed, immutable iterables instead
  of lists that need parsing and expanding.
- The classes `AllSourceFilenames`, `ExportAnnotations`, `ExportAnnotationsAllSourceFiles` and `ExportAnnotationNames`
  are now immutable iterables instead of lists.
- Removed the flags `--rerun-incomplete` and `--mark-complete`, as Sparv will now always rerun incomplete files.
- Sparv will now recognize when source files have been deleted and trigger the necessary reruns. Previously, only
  additions and modifications were recognized.
- Illegal characters are now replaced with underscore in XML element and attribute names during XML export. This also
  applies to CWB and Korp config exports.

  unit have been changed to "text".

- Renamed the installer `xml_export:install_original` to `xml_export:install`. The configuration variables
  `xml_export.export_original_host` and `xml_export.export_original_path` have been changed to
  `xml_export.export_host` and `xml_export.export_path` respectively. The configuration variables for the scrambled
  installer has been changed from `xml_export.export_host` and `xml_export.export_path` to
  `xml_export.export_scrambled_host` and `xml_export.export_scrambled_path` respectively.
- Removed `header_annotations` configuration variable from `export` (it is still available as
  `xml_export.header_annotations`).

  prefix (or be equal to the module name).
- Empty attributes are no longer included in the csv export.
- When Sparv crashes due to unexpected errors, the traceback is now hidden from the user unless the `--log debug`
  argument is used.
- If the `-j`/`--cores` option is used without an argument, all available CPU cores are used.

## [4.1.0] - 2021-04-14

  helpful).
- Slightly quicker startup time.
- Malt and Stanza no longer perform dependency parsing on tokens not belonging to any sentences.
- The `build-models` command no longer builds all models by default unless the `--all` flag is used.

## [4.0.0] - 2020-12-07

- This version contains a complete make-over of the Sparv Pipeline!
  - Everything is written in Python now (no more Makefiles or bash code).
  - Increased platform independence
  - This facilitates creating new modules, debugging, and maintenance.

- Easier installation process, Sparv is now on PyPI!
  - New plugin system facilitates installation of Sparv plugins (like FreeLing).

- New format for corpus config files
  - The new format is yaml which is easier to write and more human-readable than makefiles.
  - There is a command-line wizard which helps you create corpus config files.
  - You no longer have to specify XML elements and attributes that should be kept from the original files. The  XML
    parser now parses all existing elements and their attributes by default. Their original names will be kept and
    included in the export (unless you explicitly override this behaviour in the corpus config).

- Improved interface
  - New command line interface with help messages
  - Better feedback with progress bar instead of illegible log output (log output is still available though)
  - More helpful error messages

- New corpus import and export formats
  - Import of plain text files
  - Export to csv (a user-friendly, non-technical column format)
  - Export to (Språkbanken Text version of) CoNNL-U format
  - Export to corpus statistics (word frequency lists)

- Updated models and tools for processing Swedish corpora
  - Sparv now uses Stanza with newly trained models and higher accuracy for POS-tagging and dependency parsing on
    Swedish texts.

- Better support for annotating other (i.e. non-Swedish) languages
  - Integrated Stanford Parser for English analysis (POS-tags, baseforms, dependency parsing, named-entity recognition).
  - Added named-entity recognition for FreeLing languages.
  - If a language is supported by multiple annotation tools, you can now choose which tool to use.

- Improved code modularity
  - Increased independence between modules and language models
  - This facilitates adding new annotation modules and import/export formats.
