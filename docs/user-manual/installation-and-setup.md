# Installation and Setup

This section walks you through setting up Sparv on your computer, including any additional software you may
need to fully utilize Sparv's analysis features.

## Prerequisites

To install Sparv, you'll need a Unix-like environment (e.g. Linux, macOS or [Windows Subsystem for
Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)) with [Python 3.10](https://python.org/) or later.

> [!NOTE]
>
> While most Sparv features may work in a Windows environment, Sparv is not regularly tested on Windows, so
> compatibility is not guaranteed. Feel free to [report any issues](https://github.com/spraakbanken/sparv/issues) you
> encounter.

## Installing Sparv

Sparv is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/sparv-pipeline/) and can be installed via
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) or [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/).
We recommend using pipx, as it installs Sparv in an isolated environment but allows it to be run from any location.

Begin by [installing pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/):

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
```

Then, install Sparv:

```sh
pipx install sparv-pipeline
```

To verify that Sparv was installed successfully, run the command `sparv`. You should see the Sparv help information
displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> If pipx stops working after a Python upgrade, try running `pipx reinstall-all`. If that fails, you may need to
> manually delete pipx's local environment directory (usually `~/.local/pipx`) and reinstall Sparv.

## Setting Up Sparv

### Sparv Data Directory

Sparv requires a dedicated directory to store language models and configuration files. This is called the
**Sparv data directory**. Run `sparv setup` to choose this directory, which will also populate it with default
configurations and presets.

> [!TIP]
>
> For a non-interactive setup (e.g. in a Docker container), you can use the `--dir` flag to specify the data directory
> path and perform the setup in one command:
>
> ```sh
> sparv setup --dir /path/to/sparv-data
> ```

> [!TIP]
>
> Instead of (or in addition to) setting the data directory path using `sparv setup`, you can use the environment
> variable `SPARV_DATADIR`. This overrides any path you may have previously configured using the setup process. This is
> useful if you want to have multiple Sparv installations with different data directories on the same machine. Note that
> you still have to run the `setup` command at least once to populate the selected directory, even when using the
> environment variable.

### Optional: Pre-build Models

Sparv will automatically download and build the models needed for the analyses you want to perform. Optionally, you can
also pre-build the models to speed up the annotation of your first corpus. This step is not required, and unless you
have a specific reason to do so, we recommend skipping it, as it may download models that you won't use.

To pre-build the models, use the following command:

```sh
sparv build-models --all
```

If you run this command in a directory without a [corpus config](corpus-configuration.md), you need to specify the
language for which the models should be built. Use the `--language` flag followed by the three-letter language code (you
can use the `sparv languages` command to see a list of available languages and their codes). For example, to build all
Swedish models, run:

```sh
sparv build-models --all --language swe
```

## Installing Additional Third-party Software

Sparv can be used together with several plugins and third-party software. The installation of the software
listed below is optional and depends on the analyses you wish to perform with Sparv. Please note that different licenses
may apply to different software.

Unless otherwise specified in the instructions, you won’t need to download any additional language models. If the
software is installed correctly, Sparv will automatically download and install the necessary model files for you.

## Installing and Uninstalling Plugins

Sparv plugins are managed using the `sparv plugins` command. This command allows you to **install**, **uninstall**, and
**list** plugins. Under the hood, plugins are standard Python packages, so Sparv relies on `pip` to handle
installations. This means you can install plugins from any source supported by `pip`, such as PyPI, remote repositories,
or local directories.

### Installing Plugins

To install a plugin, use the following command:

```sh
sparv plugins install [plugin-source]
```

The `[plugin-source]` can refer to different locations:

#### Install from PyPI

To install a plugin published on the [Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/), use its name, e.g.:

```sh
sparv plugins install sparv-sbx-uppercase
```

#### Install from a Remote Repository

To install a plugin from a remote repository (e.g., GitHub), provide the repository URL or archive link:

```sh
sparv plugins install https://github.com/spraakbanken/sparv-plugin-template/archive/main.zip
```

#### Install from a Local Directory

To install a plugin from a local directory, use the path to the directory:

```sh
sparv plugins install ./sparv-sbx-uppercase
```

Using the `-e` flag when installing from a local directory will install the plugin in **editable mode**, meaning that
changes to the plugin code will immediately be available to Sparv without having to reinstall the plugin:

```sh
sparv plugins install -e ./sparv-sbx-uppercase
```

### Listing Installed Plugins

To view all installed plugins, run:

```sh
sparv plugins list
```

### Uninstalling Plugins

To uninstall a plugin, use the following command:

```sh
sparv plugins uninstall [plugin-name]
```

The `[plugin-name]` can be either the distribution name (e.g. `sparv-sbx-uppercase`), or the plugin name used within
Sparv (e.g. `sbx_uppercase`).

For example:

```sh
sparv plugins uninstall sbx_uppercase
```

## Uninstalling Sparv

To uninstall Sparv completely, follow these steps:

1. Run `sparv setup --reset` to unset [Sparv's data directory](#setting-up-sparv). The directory itself will not be
   removed, but its location (if available) will be printed.
2. Manually delete the data directory.
3. Run one of the following commands, depending on whether you installed Sparv using pipx or pip:

    ```sh
    pipx uninstall sparv-pipeline
    ```

    ```sh
    pip uninstall sparv-pipeline
    ```
